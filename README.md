## Project Description
We performed exploratory data analysis and determined which variables to use for our models. We chose four models: logistical regression, random forest, Naive Bayes, and a Cart5.0 decision tree and generated each model based on the same subset of the data. The models were evaluated using confusion matrices for accuracy, error rates, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and ROC curves to determine the best model to determine which candidates should be offered training.
